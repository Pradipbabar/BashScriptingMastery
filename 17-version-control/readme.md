# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Advanced Version Control and Collaboration

Welcome to the Advanced Version Control and Collaboration section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, we will focus on mastering advanced Git workflows using Bash, exploring Git hooks for automation and custom workflows, and collaborating effectively with distributed teams using Git features.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Advanced Git Workflows with Bash:**
    - Master advanced Git workflows using Bash for efficient version control and collaboration.

2. **Git Hooks for Automation and Custom Workflows:**
    - Explore Git hooks and learn how to leverage them for automation and custom workflows in Bash.

3. **Collaborating with Distributed Teams:**
    - Understand Git features and best practices for collaborating effectively with distributed teams using Bash.

### Getting Started

To delve into Advanced Version Control and Collaboration, follow these steps:

1. **Advanced Git Workflows with Bash:**
    - Explore advanced Git workflows, including branching strategies, rebasing, and cherry-picking, using Bash scripts.

2. **Git Hooks for Automation and Custom Workflows:**
    - Learn about Git hooks, create custom hooks using Bash scripts, and integrate them into your Git workflow.

3. **Collaborating with Distributed Teams:**
    - Understand how to effectively collaborate with distributed teams using Git, including managing branches, resolving conflicts, and code review processes.

### Advanced Git Workflows with Bash

Example of Bash script for an advanced Git workflow:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Advanced Git Workflow Example Script

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
echo "New feature changes" > new_feature.txt
git add new_feature.txt
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Rebase the feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts if any

# Push the feature branch
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Git Hooks for Automation and Custom Workflows

Example of a Git pre-commit hook in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Git Pre-Commit Hook Example Script

# Check for trailing whitespaces before committing
if git diff --cached --check; then
    echo "Pre-commit hook passed."
    exit 0
else
    echo "Error: Trailing whitespaces found. Please remove them before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Collaborating with Distributed Teams

Example of Bash script for collaborating with distributed teams:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Collaborating with Distributed Teams Example Script

# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch

# Create a new branch for a feature or bug fix
git checkout -b feature/bug-fix-branch

# Make changes, commit, and push to the remote repository
git add .
git commit -m "Fix a bug"
git push origin feature/bug-fix-branch

# Create a pull request for code review

# Fetch and merge the latest changes from the main branch
git checkout main
git pull
git merge feature/bug-fix-branch

# Resolve conflicts if any

# Push the changes to the main branch
git push origin main
```

### Additional Resources

For a deeper understanding and further exploration:

- **Git Workflows:**
    - Explore different Git workflows such as Gitflow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow.

- **Git Hooks Documentation:**
    - Refer to the official Git hooks documentation for a comprehensive overview of available hooks and their usage.

### Practice and Challenges

Reinforce your skills through practical exercises:

1. **Custom Git Workflows:**
    - Implement custom Git workflows for specific project requirements using Bash scripts.

2. **Git Hooks Customization:**
    - Create custom Git hooks for specific checks or automation tasks in your Git workflow.

3. **Distributed Team Collaboration:**
    - Simulate a distributed team scenario and practice collaborating using Git features with Bash.

# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Advanced Text Processing

Welcome to the Advanced Text Processing section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. This section focuses on mastering advanced text processing techniques using Bash commands and delving into extended regular expressions (ERE) for more sophisticated pattern matching.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Advanced Text Processing Techniques:**
    - Master advanced text processing commands in Bash.
    - Explore techniques for handling complex text manipulation scenarios.

2. **Extended Regular Expressions (ERE):**
    - Understand the extended regular expression syntax in Bash.
    - Learn to use ERE for more powerful and flexible pattern matching in text.

### Getting Started

To delve into Advanced Text Processing, follow these steps:

1. **Advanced Text Processing Commands:**
    - Explore advanced commands such as `awk`, `sed`, and `cut` for text processing.
    - Learn techniques for extracting, transforming, and analyzing text data.

2. **Extended Regular Expressions (ERE):**
    - Familiarize yourself with the extended regular expression syntax.
    - Explore ERE features like grouping, alternation, and quantifiers.

### Advanced Text Processing Commands

Example of advanced text processing using `awk`, `sed`, and `cut`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Advanced Text Processing Example Script

# Sample text data
text_data="Alice:25:Engineer
Bob:30:Doctor
Charlie:22:Student"

# Using awk to print specific columns
echo "### Using awk to Print Specific Columns ###"
echo "$text_data" | awk -F':' '{print "Name:", $1, "Age:", $2}'

# Using sed for text substitution
echo -e "\n### Using sed for Text Substitution ###"
echo "$text_data" | sed 's/Engineer/Software Engineer/'

# Using cut to extract specific fields
echo -e "\n### Using cut to Extract Specific Fields ###"
echo "$text_data" | cut -d':' -f 1,3
```

### Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)

Example of using extended regular expressions in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) Example Script

# Sample text data
text_data="apple orange banana cherry grape"

# Using ERE for pattern matching
echo "### Using ERE for Pattern Matching ###"
echo "$text_data" | grep -E 'ap(le|ple)'

# Using ERE with quantifiers
echo -e "\n### Using ERE with Quantifiers ###"
echo "$text_data" | grep -E 'a{2,}'

# Using ERE with character classes
echo -e "\n### Using ERE with Character Classes ###"
echo "$text_data" | grep -E '[aeiou]{2,}'
```

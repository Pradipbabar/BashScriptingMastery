# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Advanced System Administration Tasks

Welcome to the Advanced System Administration Tasks section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, we will focus on automating complex system administration tasks using Bash and delve into performance tuning and optimization strategies.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Automation of System Administration Tasks:**
    - Script complex system administration tasks to automate routine operations using Bash.

2. **Performance Tuning and Optimization:**
    - Learn strategies for performance tuning and optimization of a Unix-like system through Bash scripting.

### Getting Started

To delve into Advanced System Administration Tasks, follow these steps:

1. **Automation of System Administration Tasks:**
    - Explore Bash scripting techniques for automating system administration tasks related to user management, log rotation, backups, and more.

2. **Performance Tuning and Optimization:**
    - Understand the importance of performance tuning and optimization in system administration.
    - Explore practical examples of Bash scripts for optimizing system resources.

### Automation of System Administration Tasks

Example of Bash scripting for automated system administration tasks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Automated System Administration Tasks Example Script

# Rotate logs using logrotate
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

# Backup important files
backup_dir="/var/backups/$(date +"%Y%m%d")"
sudo mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
sudo cp -r /etc /var/log /home/user /var/www "$backup_dir"

# Remove old backups (retain last 7 days)
sudo find /var/backups/ -type d -ctime +7 -exec rm -r {} \;
```

### Performance Tuning and Optimization

Example of Bash scripting for performance optimization:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Performance Optimization Example Script

# Disable unnecessary services
sudo systemctl disable unneeded_service

# Adjust kernel parameters for performance
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10

# Optimize disk I/O
sudo hdparm -q -c1 -d1 /dev/sda

# Set CPU governor to performance mode
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

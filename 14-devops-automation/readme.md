# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Advanced DevOps Automation

Welcome to the Advanced DevOps Automation section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, we will focus on mastering advanced scripting techniques for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Bash. Additionally, we will explore containerization with Bash, orchestration with Docker, and scripting infrastructure as code using Bash and tools like Terraform.

### Learning Objectives

1. **CI/CD Scripting with Bash:**
    - Master advanced scripting techniques for CI/CD workflows using Bash.

2. **Containerization with Bash and Docker:**
    - Explore Bash scripting for managing containers and orchestration with Docker.

3. **Infrastructure as Code with Bash and Terraform:**
    - Script infrastructure as code using Bash and learn how to integrate it with Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

### Getting Started

To delve into Advanced DevOps Automation, follow these steps:

1. **CI/CD Scripting with Bash:**
    - Explore Bash scripting for automating build, test, and deployment processes in a CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Containerization with Bash and Docker:**
    - Understand the basics of containerization and orchestration with Docker using Bash scripts.

3. **Infrastructure as Code with Bash and Terraform:**
    - Learn how to script infrastructure as code using Bash and integrate it with Terraform for managing infrastructure resources.

### CI/CD Scripting with Bash

Example of Bash scripting for CI/CD workflows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CI/CD Scripting Example

# Build and package the application
echo "Building the application..."
./build.sh

# Run unit tests
echo "Running unit tests..."
./run_tests.sh

# Deploy to staging environment
echo "Deploying to staging environment..."
./deploy_staging.sh

# Run integration tests
echo "Running integration tests..."
./run_integration_tests.sh

# Deploy to production environment
echo "Deploying to production environment..."
./deploy_production.sh

echo "CI/CD process completed successfully."
```

### Containerization with Bash and Docker

Example of Bash scripting for Docker:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Docker Orchestration Example

# Build Docker image
docker build -t my_app .

# Run Docker container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_app_container my_app

# Check container status
docker ps

# Stop and remove container
docker stop my_app_container
docker rm my_app_container
```

### Infrastructure as Code with Bash and Terraform

Example of Bash scripting for Terraform integration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Infrastructure as Code Example with Terraform

# Set Terraform variables
TF_VAR_region="us-west-2"
TF_VAR_instance_type="t2.micro"

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the infrastructure changes
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Apply the infrastructure changes
terraform apply tfplan

# Display outputs
terraform output
```

### Additional Resources

For a deeper understanding and further exploration:

- **Advanced CI/CD Techniques:**
    - Explore advanced CI/CD techniques and strategies for efficient and reliable pipelines.

- **Docker Orchestration Tools:**
    - Learn about additional Docker orchestration tools like Kubernetes and how they can be scripted with Bash.

### Practice and Challenges

Reinforce your skills through practical exercises:

1. **Customize CI/CD Workflows:**
    - Customize the provided CI/CD script to fit the needs of your specific application and deployment process.

2. **Dockerize Applications:**
    - Dockerize an existing application using Bash scripts for building, running, and managing containers.

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
    - Develop Bash scripts to automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.

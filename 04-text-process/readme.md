# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Text Processing Basics

Welcome to the Text Processing Basics section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. This section is designed to help you explore basic text processing using Bash commands and gain a solid understanding of regular expressions for pattern matching.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Basic Text Processing Commands:**
    - Explore fundamental Bash commands for processing and manipulating text.
    - Learn techniques for extracting, transforming, and displaying text content.

2. **Regular Expressions (Regex):**
    - Understand the concept of regular expressions as a powerful tool for pattern matching.
    - Learn how to use basic regex patterns for searching and manipulating text.

### Getting Started

To dive into Text Processing Basics, follow these steps:

1. **Explore Basic Text Commands:**
    - Learn commands such as `cat` for displaying file contents, `grep` for searching text, `awk` for text processing, and `sed` for text substitution.

2. **Understand Regular Expressions:**
    - Familiarize yourself with the syntax and patterns of regular expressions.
    - Learn about basic regex elements, including character classes, quantifiers, and anchors.

### Basic Text Processing Commands

Here are examples of basic text processing commands:

1. **`cat` - Concatenate and Display:**
    - Basic Usage: `cat filename`

2. **`grep` - Search Text:**
    - Basic Usage: `grep pattern filename`
    - Options:
        - `-i`: Case-insensitive search
        - `-n`: Show line numbers

3. **`awk` - Text Processing:**
    - Basic Usage: `awk '{print $1}' filename`
    - Example: Extracts the first column of a file.

4. **`sed` - Stream Editor:**
    - Basic Usage: `sed 's/pattern/replacement/' filename`
    - Example: Substitutes a pattern with a replacement in a file.

### Regular Expressions (Regex)

Basic regex patterns:

1. **Character Classes:**
    - `[aeiou]`: Matches any vowel.
    - `[^0-9]`: Matches any non-digit.

2. **Quantifiers:**
    - `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences.
    - `+`: Matches one or more occurrences.

3. **Anchors:**
    - `^`: Matches the beginning of a line.
    - `$`: Matches the end of a line.

### Additional Resources

For a deeper understanding and further exploration:

- **Online Regex Testers:**
    - Use online tools to test and visualize your regex patterns.

- **Regex Cheat Sheets:**
    - Refer to cheat sheets for a quick reference to regex syntax.

### Practice and Challenges

Reinforce your skills through practical exercises:

1. **Search and Display Text:**
    - Use `cat` and `grep` to display and search text in files.

2. **Text Processing with `awk`:**
    - Experiment with `awk` to process and extract specific columns from text files.

3. **Text Substitution with `sed`:**
    - Practice text substitution using `sed` to replace patterns in files.

### Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Text Processing Basics section! You now have a foundation in basic text processing commands and a grasp of regular expressions for pattern matching. Continue to the next sections to further enhance your Bash scripting skills. Happy scripting!

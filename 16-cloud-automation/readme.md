# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Scripting for Cloud Environments

Welcome to the Scripting for Cloud Environments section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, we will focus on developing scripts for automating tasks in cloud environments using Bash. Additionally, we will explore cloud-native scripting languages and tools that can be integrated with Bash for efficient cloud automation.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Cloud Automation with Bash:**
    - Develop scripts for automating tasks specific to cloud environments using Bash.

2. **Cloud-Native Scripting Languages and Tools:**
    - Explore cloud-native scripting languages and tools that complement Bash for enhanced cloud automation.

### Getting Started

To delve into Scripting for Cloud Environments, follow these steps:

1. **Cloud Automation with Bash:**
    - Understand the capabilities of Bash for cloud automation.
    - Develop scripts for common cloud-related tasks such as provisioning resources, managing instances, and interacting with cloud APIs.

2. **Cloud-Native Scripting Languages and Tools:**
    - Explore cloud-native scripting languages such as AWS CLI, Google Cloud SDK, and Azure CLI.
    - Learn how to integrate these tools with Bash for seamless cloud automation.

### Cloud Automation with Bash

Example of Bash script for AWS S3 operations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# AWS S3 Operations Example Script

# Upload a file to S3 bucket
aws s3 cp local_file.txt s3://my_bucket/

# Download a file from S3 bucket
aws s3 cp s3://my_bucket/remote_file.txt .

# List objects in S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://my_bucket/
```

### Cloud-Native Scripting Languages and Tools with Bash

Example of Bash script using Google Cloud SDK:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Google Cloud SDK Example Script

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# List Google Cloud Storage buckets
gsutil ls

# Create a new Compute Engine instance
gcloud compute instances create my-instance --image-family debian-10 --image-project debian-cloud
```

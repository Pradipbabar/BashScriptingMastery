# Bash Scripting Mastery

## Advanced Process Management

Welcome to the Advanced Process Management section of the Bash Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, we will dive into process synchronization, inter-process communication (IPC), and explore how to handle signals in Bash scripts for efficient process management.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Process Synchronization:**
    - Understand the concept of process synchronization in Bash.
    - Explore techniques for coordinating and controlling the execution of multiple processes.

2. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
    - Learn about inter-process communication methods in Bash scripts.
    - Explore ways to exchange data and synchronize processes.

3. **Handling Signals:**
    - Understand the basics of signals in a Unix-like environment.
    - Explore techniques for handling signals in Bash scripts.

### Getting Started

To delve into Advanced Process Management, follow these steps:

1. **Process Synchronization:**
    - Understand scenarios where process synchronization is beneficial.
    - Explore commands and techniques for controlling process execution.

2. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
    - Learn about IPC methods such as pipes, signals, and shared memory.
    - Explore practical examples of exchanging data between processes.

3. **Handling Signals:**
    - Familiarize yourself with common Unix signals and their meanings.
    - Explore ways to handle signals in Bash scripts, ensuring graceful termination.

### Process Synchronization

Example of process synchronization in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Process Synchronization Example Script

# Start a background process
(sleep 5; echo "Process 1 completed") &

# Wait for the background process to finish
wait

echo "Process 2 starting"
# Start another process
(sleep 3; echo "Process 2 completed") &

# Wait for all background processes to finish
wait

echo "All processes completed"
```

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Example of inter-process communication using pipes in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Example Script

# Process 1: Produces data
echo "Data from Process 1" > data.txt

# Process 2: Consumes data
cat data.txt
```

### Handling Signals

Example of handling signals in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Handling Signals Example Script

# Function to handle interrupt signal (Ctrl+C)
handle_interrupt() {
    echo "Script interrupted. Cleaning up..."
    # Perform cleanup tasks
    exit 1
}

# Register signal handler
trap handle_interrupt SIGINT

# Main execution section
echo "Running the script. Press Ctrl+C to interrupt."

# Simulating a long-running process
sleep 10

# Clean exit without interruption
echo "Script completed successfully."
```

### Additional Resources

### Practice and Challenges

Reinforce your skills through practical exercises:

1. **Multi-Process Scenarios:**
    - Create scripts that involve multiple processes and practice synchronization techniques.

2. **Advanced IPC Tasks:**
    - Experiment with different IPC methods for exchanging data between processes.

3. **Robust Signal Handling:**
    - Implement signal handling in scripts to ensure robust and graceful termination.
